# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.

If Security Advisories are not available, open a private communication channel with the maintainers and include:
- a clear impact description
- affected endpoints/paths and versions/commits
- minimal reproduction steps (no weaponized payloads)
- suggested remediation (if known)

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a remediation plan as quickly as possible.
