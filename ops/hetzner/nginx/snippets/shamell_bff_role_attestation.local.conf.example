# Host-local role-header attestation for BFF (optional).
# This file is intended to live on the server as:
#   /etc/nginx/snippets/shamell_bff_role_attestation.local.conf
# Keep it root-owned and mode 0600.
#
# Add directives only when you have a trusted edge/auth source.
# Example (conceptual):
#   proxy_set_header X-Role-Auth "<same-secret-as-BFF_ROLE_HEADER_SECRET>";
#   proxy_set_header X-Auth-Roles $http_x_trusted_roles;
#
# Leave empty to keep admin/operator role headers disabled at the edge.
